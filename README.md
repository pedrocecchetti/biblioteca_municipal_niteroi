## Stack
I'm still understanding which Stack am I gonna use.


## Motivation
One day I went to the library and asked for a book.  
The lady physically searched the book.   
I asked if they had a managing software but the answer was categorical and :   
"No we don't!".  
I wanted to help my city and so the idea of this project emerged!  

## What it will do?
#### The application will allow 3 types of users to register:  
- Super User (All functionalities + config)
- Funcionários (access to all functionalities) 
- Usuários (Only access to search)

#### It will have the basic functionalities:
- Add Book: Add book to database(Name, Edition, Author, Genre, id)
- Remove Book: Remove book from DB
- Lend Book: Assign book to specific user, max: 5 books
- Recieve Book: Unassign book from specific User
- Search: Search around all DB
- Add User: Add User(Nome, Sobrenome, CPF, e-mail) 

## Observations
All this Project is a way of training my programming Skills.
