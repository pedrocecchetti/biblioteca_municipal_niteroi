## Stack
I'm still understanding which Stack am I gonna use.


## Motivation
One day I went to the library and asked for a book.  
The lady physically searched the book.   
I asked if they had a managing software but the answer was categorical and :   
"No we don't!".  
I wanted to help my city and so the idea of this project emerged!  


## Observations
All this Project is a way of training my programming Skills.
